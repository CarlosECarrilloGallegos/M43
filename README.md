# M43
This directory currently houses common function I've used for finding M43's Column Density and Mass in Functions.py.

It also walks through the column density and mass calculation process for 13CO in a jupyter notebook.

Updates will include estimates with C18O, and functions related to position-velocity diagrams and finding pressure, kinetic energy, and momentum of region.
